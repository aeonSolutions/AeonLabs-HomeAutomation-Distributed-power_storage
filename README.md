# Distributed Power Storage

**The problem**

Now that a universal cable connector is a reality, the USB-C, the next big change is on how to remove all those power converters and inverters at home, vis-a-vis, " power bricks". These can waste up to 30% of electricity "converted". And in my professional opinion, the best and only way to do it is by adding a small mechanical switch, however, mechanical relays consume too much power (around 200mW). 

<br>

**The ideia**

To solve the 30% wasted on conversion, the only way is, to reduce to the minimum "power bricks" needed /required. This can be achieved by installing several electricity lines in parallel connected to each power outlet in a room, nowadays with built-in USB connectivity. USB-C power delivery is capable to manage automatically powerlines up to 20V 5A DC meaning all indoor LED illumination, laptop computers, smartphones & tablets, and all smart devices including big OLED TV screens.

One possible solution to solve electricity consumption in standby mode is by using a micro stepped DC motor connected to simple electronics with "deep sleep" with or without wireless capabilities. This way is possible to lower consumption to 2-8uAÂ @Â 3.3VÂ DC.

The main objective of this project is to negotiate power delivery to each individual power outlet sockets from a master Distributed Power Management System. Is possible to achive this using only 2 wires where one of them is used for both power and data transmission. There's a really good one-wire library [here](https://github.com/M-o-a-T/owslave) that enables one to build such power delivery setup.

## Electronic Devices Prototyped
- [45,000mA Power Wall using 18650 Lithium Polymer Batteries](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/AeonLabs-HomeAutomation-45-000mA-Power-Wall-18650-Lithium-Polymer-Batteries)

  Here in Belgium, is often found all kinds of home appliances when walking on the sidewalk. And anyone is free to take them. Gratis. The other day i picked up on the street this blue ray device. And, as i always do, the first thing i did was to disassemble it to its individual partsÂ andÂ components. It has capacity for 45,000mA @ 4.2VÂ DC, More than enough for powering of the grid all 5-9V DC  devices and appliances atÂ anyÂ familyÂ home. During winter days , rainy days, this power ðŸ”‹ wall will charge itself from the main 220V AC but only during the night when electricityÂ isÂ muchÂ cheaper. The estimated savings on the electricity bill at the end of the month are expected to be betweenÂ 10eurÂ toÂ 20eur. Payback time is only 10 months. The minimum efficiency of this power wallÂ isÂ 95%Â  With an LCD display for some cool consumption statistics and threeÂ buttonsÂ forÂ ......I don't know yetÂ !

- [Automatic Power Delivery USB DC Power Outlet]() ( soon. stay tuned)

This is a smart device made to fit this EU 220V power outlet with 2 USB A port selling [here](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DlU2D7j).  This smart device enables power delivery management on low powered DC lines, in the range of 3.3V to 20V DC and up to 100W. Each individual USB-A port can be setup to deliver individual DC output. For instance 5V DC on one port and 12V DC on the other.  The innovation on this particular smart electronics is in its ability to deliver USB power with the capability of automatic negotiation of voltage from anywhere between 5V and 20V and up to 100W.  While this project does not start, here's a great [video tutorial](https://www.instructables.com/DIY-USB-Type-C-Power-Delivery-Trigger-Board/) by GreatScott.
